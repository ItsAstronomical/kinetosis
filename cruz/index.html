<br><p>I HATE TED CRUZ is a single that we released on November 6th, 2021. In order to ensure maximum authenticity and include only the most relevant and up to date information, Franklin wrote the lyrics to the title track while he was in Washington DC. Ted Cruz was not informed of this, sadly, as he was too busy committing fellatio-esque actions on a handheld crucifix. Perhaps one day, Mr. Cruz will listen to the lyrics off of this song and realize why <b>Kinetosis,</b> the greatest band in the history of band ever, made their first single a diss against <i>him.</i></p>
<p>I HATE TED CRUZ was also the first Kinetosis release to adopt the age old tradition of including 3 B-sides with each single. Wackily enough, the biggest "hit" (if you can call it that) from this single was one of the B-sides, the legendary FRED DURST SEX TAPE. Since its release, FRED DURST SEX TAPE has grossed hundreds of views on YouTube, interrupted steamy situations between multiple lovers, and even been included and reviewed in the Fanboys Podcast hosted by writers for The Hard Times Magazine. Kona claims he's "not shocked by fred durst sex tapes success as it is arguably still our best song". Honestly the rest of us agree - he has a point.</p>
